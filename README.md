**Flight Delay Prediction Project**

**Introduction:**
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the flight status of United Airlines during April 21-24. The project utilizes a random forest classifier algorithm for training the model with a designated dataset sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The goal is to accurately classify flights as "early," "on-time," "late," or "severely late" based on various features.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Initial Exploration:**
    - Importing necessary libraries
    - Loading dataset from CSV
    - Overview of the project goals and methodology
    
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handling missing data
    - Parsing and sorting data
    - Cleaning unwanted columns
    - Transforming data types and formats
    - Filtering columns with specific data types
    - Other preprocessing steps
    
3. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Creating new features for flight status classification
    - Creating "Weather_Delay" feature
    
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualization):**
    - Bar plots of airline data features
    - Exploring correlations using a heatmap
    
5. **Feature Selection:**
    - Removing unnecessary features
    - Modifying features in the airline dataset
    
6. **One-Hot Encoding Categorical Features:**
    - Creating dummy variables
    
7. **Feature Scaling:**
    - Standardization and transformation of features
    
8. **Model Selection and Evaluation:**
    - Splitting data into training and testing sets
    - Training Random Forest Classifier
    - Performance evaluation
    
9. **Performing Predictions (April 21 â€“ April 24):**
    - Loading test data
    - Data preprocessing on test data
    - Feature engineering on test data

    - Predicting flight status for April (21-24) test data
    - Label encoding of predicted status values in test data
    - Saving predictions to a CSV file
    
10. **Results and Discussion:**
    - Analysis of predictions
    - Output file overview
    
11. **Conclusion:**
    - Summary of findings
    - Suggestions for further improvements
    
**Output Files:**
